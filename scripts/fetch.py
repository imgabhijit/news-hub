"""
Fetches YouTube videos for all channels and saves to data/videos.json.

Channel metadata (playlist IDs + subscribers) is cached in data/channels_meta.json
and only refreshed when older than META_STALE_DAYS.

Quota budget (the YouTube Data API gives 10,000 units/day):
  - 1 unit per channel     -> playlistItems.list, one page in the steady state
  - 1 unit per 50 video IDs -> videos.list, batched across the whole section

  Video details are NOT re-fetched for every cached video on every run. Only
  brand-new IDs, videos younger than STATS_REFRESH_WINDOW, and videos that are
  live/upcoming are refreshed; everything else keeps the record already stored
  in videos.json.

  Sections are scanned on their own cadence (see SECTION_CADENCE_HOURS): news
  and opinion every run, the neighbour sections every third. A run scans a
  channel when it is overdue rather than on a fixed clock window, so a run
  that dies on quota leaves it overdue for the next one instead of skipping
  it for a whole cycle.

  Playlist scans run on a thread pool: the same API calls and the same quota,
  but the run is latency-bound, so it finishes several times faster.
